Dear Marjorie, Mandy, Heather, and all the Kyle Field / Levy team,

Troop 1861 would like to offer you our sincere THANKS for your support of the troop fundraiser at the MS150 bicycle race.

Our troop was able to deliver water and ice to the cycling teams and hundreds of individual riders who ended their ride at Kyle Field this April, bringing much needed refreshment to the riders and their supporters.

Our troop uses this opportunity not just to support the MS150 ride and our community, but to build leadership skills among the Scouts. With some logistics support from the troop parents, the bulk of the ice and water distribution was handled entirely by our Scout youth. They learned about planning ahead, interacting with our "customers", and dealing with unexpected challenges, all while demonstrating Scout Spirit by keeping a positive attitude and lending a hand wherever they saw a need.

We are truly grateful for the opportunity you have allowed for us to work with MS150. The money we raise will support our troop in Camping, Summer Camp, special awards, and to keep dues low.

Thank you so much for supporting Scouting and your community.

Sincerely,
Troop 1861, College Station, Texas
